# Library_Database
Working database for a small library
The database is used in a library setting where books are taken out on loan for a set period. 
When a book is withdrawn the database records: 
1.	The member who withdraws the book.
2.	The date the book must be returned.
If a member is late on returning a book.
1.	A fine is issued to the member account.
2.	 The book is registered as not returned.
The database has tables that hold records of the books, authors and publishers along with the member details and account information.  
1.	Queries can be used to access the database for book selection by the member.
2.	 The library staff can use the database to look up member who have fines outstanding or over due books. 
3.	The database keeps an inventory of all the books in stock, either withdrawn or not.
